# System Overview Diagram
- [Python CLI Calculator]
  - Component A (CLI Interface)
  - Component B (Arithmetic Logic)
  - Component C (Input/Output Handling)

# Data Flow Diagrams
**Diagram 1: Input Validation and Operation Execution**
- User inputs two numbers along with the type of operation to perform via the CLI interface.
- The Input/Output Handling component validates if the input is a number, handles non-numeric or division by zero errors gracefully.
- Once validated, the Arithmetic Logic receives the clean data and performs the requested arithmetic operation.

**Diagram 2: Result Presentation**
- After performing an arithmetic operation, the result (or error message) travels back through Input/Output Handling to be formatted for output display.
- The CLI Interface then presents this information to the user in a clear format.

# Component Descriptions
## Component A: CLI Interface
- Description: Manages the command-line interface for user interaction.
- Responsibilities: Accepts input via the command line, provides usage instructions and feedback to users.
- Tools/Libraries Used: argparse

## Component B: Arithmetic Logic
- Description: Handles the arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Responsibilities: Executes mathematical calculations based on user inputs and passes results back through the CLI interface.
- Tools/Libraries Used: Built-in math module or custom implementation for specific error handling

## Component C: Input/Output Handling
- Description: Ensures proper formatting of input data and output presentation, manages exceptions.
- Responsibilities: Validates numerical input, manages error handling for edge cases (e.g., division by zero), formats the display of results to the user.
- Tools/Libraries Used: None specific, but relies on Python's built-in capabilities for input validation and exception handling

# Data Models
- Data Model A (OperationInput)
  - Fields:
    - operation_type (string): Type of arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
    - operand1 (float): First number
    - operand2 (float): Second number

- Data Model B (CalculationResult)
  - Fields:
    - result_value (float): Result of the arithmetic operation or None if an error occurred.
    - error_message (string): Error message if an error occurred during calculation, null otherwise.

# API Specifications
There are no APIs involved for this command-line application as it does not interface with external services.

# Implementation Roadmap
1. Develop CLI Interface using argparse library
2. Implement Arithmetic Logic to perform basic operations with proper error handling.
3. Create Input/Output Handling component to ensure correct data flow and formatting.
4. Test each component independently for correctness before integration testing.
